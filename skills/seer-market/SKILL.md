## Command Reference

### Entity lookup

```bash
seer-q search "QUERY"           # Fuzzy search across topics, threads, assets
seer-q topic TOPIC_ID           # Topic detail: thesis, bias, all threads within it
seer-q thread THREAD_ID         # Thread detail: snapshot, all claims, evidence counts
```

### List / browse

```bash
seer-q market                   # Global regime + all topics with thread counts
seer-q topics                   # List all topics with thread counts
seer-q threads                  # List all threads (newest activity first)
seer-q threads --topic ID       # Threads in a specific topic
seer-q threads --status active  # Filter by status (active/weakening/divided/resolved)
seer-q claims                   # Latest 100 claims (newest first)
seer-q claims --thread ID       # Claims for a specific thread
seer-q claims --status current  # Filter by status (pending/current/stale/discarded)
seer-q claims --mode observed   # Filter by mode (observed/interpreted/forecast/attributed)
seer-q sources                  # Latest 100 ingested sources
seer-q sources --decision process  # Only processed sources
seer-q sources --tier 1         # Only tier-1 sources
```

### Snapshots

```bash
seer-q snapshot                 # Latest global regime snapshot
seer-q snapshot --history       # Regime snapshot history (default 10)
seer-q snapshot --history --limit 5  # Limit history count
```

### Usage & audit

```bash
seer-q usage                    # Token usage summary (--since P, default 24h)
seer-q decisions                # Decision log (--stage S, --run ID, --entity-type T, --entity-id I, --limit N)
```

## Query Strategy

Map the user's question to the right command sequence:

| User intent | Commands |
|---|---|
| Overall market / "how's the market" | `seer-q market` |
| List all topics | `seer-q topics` |
| Hottest/most active topic | `seer-q topics` → pick highest `thread_count` or most recent activity |
| Specific sector deep-dive (e.g., "AI infra") | `seer-q search "KEYWORDS"` → `seer-q topic ID` |
| Specific angle/trade (e.g., "NVIDIA bear case") | `seer-q search "KEYWORDS"` → `seer-q thread ID` |
| Analyze an asset (e.g., "analyze NVIDIA") | `seer-q search "ASSET"` → fetch relevant topic + multiple thread details |
| Latest events / recent claims | `seer-q claims` → summarize the newest entries |
| Claims for a thread | `seer-q claims --thread ID` |
| Recent sources / what was ingested | `seer-q sources` |
| Bull/bear case for X | `seer-q search "X"` → `seer-q thread ID` → focus on `risk_case`, contradicting claims |
| Market regime history / trend | `seer-q snapshot --history` |
| Global regime details | `seer-q snapshot` |
| Threads in a topic | `seer-q threads --topic ID` or `seer-q topic ID` (which includes threads) |

## Examples

User: "how's the market"
-> `seer-q market`
-> Summarize regime_summary, verdict, top topics by thread count
-> Include market view_url

User: "latest 10 events"
-> `seer-q claims`
-> Take first 10 from response (already sorted newest-first)
-> Summarize each claim: statement, event_date, asset_mentions
-> Note: no view_url on individual claims

User: "hottest topic right now"
-> `seer-q topics`
-> Find topic with highest thread_count or most recent thread activity
-> `seer-q topic ID` for detail
-> Summarize thesis, bias, top threads
-> Include topic view_url

-> Include all view_urls

User: "what's the bear case for AI"
-> `seer-q search "AI"`
-> Find bearish/weakening threads
